Some remarks about the source files:
====================================

To make CONVZ80, assemble convz80.8 using A86
To make GETRS, assemble getrs.8 using A86
To make CONVERT, assemble convcode.8 to convcode.obj, compile convert.c and
   link it with convcode.obj. (With BC 3.1 use a .PRJ project file; with
   Turbo C 2.0 link it by hand or add convcode.obj to the main library file...)
To make Z80DUMP, compile z80dump.c
To make Z802TAP, compile z802tap.c and link it with loader.obj
To make DISCIPLE, compile disciple.c

The source code of the .Z80 file of the TAP2TAPE utility is in TAP2TAPE.TXT

The source files of the SamRam are in SAMSRC.TAP, in the format used by
   GENS3.  If you don't have GENS3 you can convert the source files to
   text files using SAMLIST.BAT.  Sorry about the lack of comments, but memory
   was scarce back then!
