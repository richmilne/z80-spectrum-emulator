16/4/93         Version 2.00 released.

              - Z80 now supports the Spectrum 128, including '128 sound
                through PC speaker or AdLib compatible sound card,
              - Dutch documentation rewritten in English,
              - Much better tape support, with tape files on disk, support
                of headerless files and more difficult formats, easy access
                to programs using LOAD "name", multiple files in a single
                tape file, automatic mirroring of loaded blocks to tape
                files,
              - Microdrive support, 8 microdrives with cartridge-files
                holding up to 126K of data, low-level I/O compatibility,
              - VGA support, fast screen update and accurate colours
                including bright,
              - Z80 emulation nearly perfect, including emulation of
                inofficial flags and undocumented features. Timing of
                individual instructions is made much more accurate on fast
                computers, while maintaining maximum possible speed on slow
                ones,
              - Spectrum keyboard layout help-screen under ALT-F1,
         (*)  - Disciple/+D disk read utility can translate 48K and 128K
                snapshots to .Z80 files, and screen snapshots and normal
                files to .TAP files. It will now also read 5.25'' (720K
                80 track double density) disks, and some bugs have been
                fixed,
              - Z80 now reads a .INI file at startup for default settings,
              - Changing the hardware (SamRam, Spectrum 128) now possible
                on-the-fly,
              - The R register and LDIR emulation flags are saved in .Z80
                snapshots,
         (*)  - The emulation speed slowdown is now accurate from 8 MHz PC's
                to the fastest available 486 machines. The emulation speed
                can be brought back to 7%,
         (*)  - Source files now include source of SamRam software,
              - Support of AZERTY keyboards,
              - The emulator can now run under Windows,
              - Emulator can use other default 16K rom (switch -xr),
              - The program uses EMS if available, for fast bank switching,
         (*)  - CONVERT utility can now also convert a screen to a .PCX file,
         (*)  - CONVZ80 now also supports the .PRG and tape files of SpecEm
                (Kevin J. Phair) and tape files of ZX (Rindt and Brukner),
         (*)  - New utility: Z802TAP, to convert a .Z80 snapshot to a .TAP
                tap file,
         (*)  - New utility: TAP2TAPE, to write a .TAP file back to tape,
              - Fixed CGA colours bug,

14/8/92         Version 1.45 released.

              - Z80 emulator is now about 5% faster. Arnt Gulbrandsen,
                the author of JPP, pointed out to me that I was clearing
                the BL register too often.
              - The analogue joystick now really works
         (*)  - SAVEing programs to tape now really works (if you're a
                registered user)
              - You can now load .SNA files (commonly used snapshot format)
                directly into the emulator, without having to convert them
                with ConvZ80.
              - The Interface-I RS232 channel can now also be attached to
                COM3 and COM4.
         (*)  - ConvZ80 now also supports the .SP format used by a Spectrum
                emulator called 'SPECTRUM', written by Pedro Gimeno.
              - A capacitor in DIAGRAMS.Z80 had the wrong value (17-8-92)
              - .SNA files that were loaded were not properly closed,
                resulting in a FILE NOT FOUND error. (17-8-92)



27/7/92         Version 1.41 released. The 1.40 version of Z80.EXE was
                packed with COMPACK (sort of PKLITE), which was bugged:
                it didn't run on some '386s and '486s. This version isn't
                packed anymore.



16/7/92         Version 1.40 released, Shareware and for registered
                users.

         (*)  - Full tape support! A program DIAGRAMS.Z80 is supplied,
                that consists of two diagrams of tape-adapters for PC's,
                and a test-program useful for calibration of the
                adapters.
         (*)  - A utility to read DISCiPLE floppies.
              - The analogue IBM joystick and a special interface for
                digital (Spectrum) joysticks are supported. In the
                documentationfile is a diagram for the digital joystick
                interface.
              - A more extensive manual, and a summary for English-
                speaking users.
              - Speed measurement of the Z80 emulator is more accurate.
                (V1.20 overestimated the speed.)
              - Functionkeys F1-F7 and F10 are now used.
              - The Emulator can run in 'Real'-mode, for better sound
                and for tape (speed-)load and save.
              - R register emulation is now perfect, so that protected
                games (e.g. lenslock games) can be loaded.
              - Video routines are faster.
              - Several bugfixes concerning writes in ROM. (Strong Man)
              - The settings of Issue 2 emulation, Double Interrupt
                frequency, Video synchronisation mode and joystick are
                stored in .Z80 files.



6/11/91         Version 1.30, for registered users only:

              - It is now much easier to choose a file from the main
                menu: the cursor keys, PgUp and PgDn can be used to
                browse through the list of files, and letter-keys make
                the bar jump to the first file that starts with that
                letter. The files are now alphabetically ordened.
              - Sinclair joystick 1 added (keys 1-5)
              - If a path is entered at the command line, the Emulator
                automatically jumps to the main menu, option 'load
                program', and changes to the specified directory.
              - If a file is attached to the RS232 in- or output
                channel, the read- or write-position is shown (main
                menu, options I and O)
              - Switches -yl and -yh are added, for Low and High video
                synchronisation. With these switches, the flickering of
                sprites of some games can be reduced. (Ghost 'n Goblins,
                Uridium)
              - Bugfix: DOS-clock ran too fast in version 1.25
              - Bugfix: On AT's the Emulator crashed if Spectrum programs
                used interrupt mode 2 while the I register was 255.
                (Full Throttle)
              - Inofficial flags are now emulated better. (Ghost'n Goblins)
         (*)  - Extra utility CONVZ80, converts .Z80 files in .SP and
                .SNA files, the snapshot formats of the Spanish Spectrum
                emulator VGASPEC and the Norwegian Spectrum emulator JPP
                respectively, and vice versa.
         (*)  - Utility Z80DUMP; displays the header of .Z80 files.



4/10/91         Version 1.25, for registered users only:

              - Bugfix of instructions CB30 to CB37 (Bounder)
              - 50 Hz interrupt and video update run 180 degrees out of
                phase (BC Quest for Tires)
              - SLA, SRA, SRL sped up.
         (*)  - Switch -z added: the Emulator now can be slowed down to
                about a factor 4.
              - Bugfix sound: some computers only produced sound after a
                OUT 31,13.
              - Switch -2 added for Issue-2 emulation (Spinads)
              - Bugfix GETRS: now reading from COM2 works, and an
                on-screen counter shows the progress.
         (*)  - CONVERT extended: GIF-files can be made directly from
                .Z80 files
