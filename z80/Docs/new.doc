10/8/96         Version 3.04 released

              - Supports .SLT 'Super Loader Trap' files with level data and
                loading screens.  Added utility ADDDAT.
              - Much better keyboard handling and speed measuring in DOS
                boxes running under Windows (95)
          (*) - Added utility READSB to read .VOC sample files from
                SoundBlaster compat. sound card, and digitally filter them.
                This finally enables reliable loading via a SoundBlaster.
          (*) - Bugfix: Disciple snapshots don't overwrite old data anymore
              - Needs 16K less memory: fast/full/minimal (default,-xt,-xu):
                564K, 517K, 481K; uses 240K less base memory if Extended
                Memory is present.  No support anymore for Extended
                Hercules and Plantronics video modes.
          (*) - Switch -00 added, to suppress pause at intro screen
              - Z80 now ejects paper from laserprinters when ZX Printing.
                (switch -0f N)
              - Added tech info about ZX Printer, AY-3-8912 sound chip, and
                Spectrum 128 internals.
          (*) - VOC files are high-pass filtered when played back, to make
                loading less sensitive to 50 Hz component.
              - Support for 2nd analogue joystick as Sinclair 1 joystick
                added.
              - The emulator returns 'No ZX Printer attached' if the output
                printer is not there or off-line; previously the emulator
                hang on a COPY with no printer to print to. Switch -xj
                added.  (Lords of Midnight, SuperSpy)
              - Added -xy trace feature
              - Added -0m opcode mapping feature, for use with (a future
                version of) Leslie Styles' disassembler DSNA
              - Switch -kx added, for custom remapping of keyboard.
              - Addresses are entered as decimal numbers by default now;
                hex can be used by prefixing the address with a # or $
                sign.
              - Added explanation of Break Points in documentation (section
                2.21) (Douglas Paulley)
              - Novell broadcasts are disabled (Damion Yates)
              - Timer routine made faster.
          (*) - Bugfix: Disciple/+D track buffer bug fixed.
              - Bugfix: SoundBlaster is properly turned off at exit
              - Bugfix: RES/SET opcodes can't change ROM anymore (Catch23
                and Batman, the Capped Crusade; thanks to Gerardo Oporto
                Jorrin)
              - Bugfix: CTRL-ENTER when loading snapshot now also keeps
                part of hardware mode fixed.
              - Opcode for loading levels is ED FB, not ED F6 as the
                documentation said previously. (Russell Marks)
              - Bugfix: Loading snapshot saved in +D hardware mode with no
                PLUSDROM.BIN file present does not return Z80 to DOS
                anymore.
              - Bugfix: settings are read correctly from snapshot file
                specified on command line.
              - Bugfix: '128 I/O ports are decoded properly (Three Weeks in
                Paradise 128; Tomaz Kac)



29/12/94        Version 3.03 released

         (*)  - OUT2VOC now also handles 128k soundchip output.
         (*)  - TAP2VOC can now produce raw sample files.
              - Bugfix: Mouse and analogue joystick work together and
                properly. (Niccolo Rigacci)
              - Improved Hi Color Resolution emulation; the emulator uses
                different timings in 128K modes, and locks in on memory
                pushes to synchronise.  Most programs that use HCR effects
                work correctly now.
              - Bugfix: Without EMS memory, Multiface 128 did not work.
              - Small error fixed and explanation added in DOC about new
                .Z80 file headers (Arnt Gulbrandsen).
              - Added: Switch to turn off Hi Color Resolution emulation
                completely; this saves another 40K over -xt.

              - Added: Information in documentation on Spectrum 128 video
                timings, and interrupt timings.
              - In 128 mode, out address 7FFD is decoded using only A15
                (and low order byte), making at least one problem program
                run. (Igor 'Iggy' Eged)



3/11/94         Version 3.02 released

              - Bugfix: Without EMS memory, a Spectrum error with IF1 on
                locked the emulator or generated an 'IN 0 crash'.
         (*)  - Bugfix: OUT2VOC did not work properly for long samples.



28/10/94        Version 3.01 released

              - Bugfix: The ZX Printer code for Epson printer was faulty.
              - The phone number for B.G. Services in Z80.DOC was wrong.
              - The emulator can now log Z80 OUTs to any I/O port in a .OUT
                file, with timing information.
         (*)  - Added utility (OUT2VOC) to translate .OUT log files into
                .VOC sound sample files, for recording music and SAVEing
                directly to a .VOC file.
              - Added a new section to the documentation about the Disciple
                and +D interfaces.

              - ZX Printer support, for Epson and HP Laserjet compatibles
              - Emulation of hi-resolution color and border effects, using
                exact timing.
              - Multiface 128 emulation; useful to load M128 snaps without
                corrupting the screen
              - Mouse support, controlling either Spectrum joysticks or the
                AMS Mouse interface (supported by e.g. Art Studio)
              - A number of improvements and bugfixes of the Z80 processor

14/8/92         Version 1.45 released.

              - Z80 emulator is now about 5% faster. Arnt Gulbrandsen,
                the author of JPP, pointed out to me that I was clearing
                the BL register too often.
              - The analogue joystick now really works
         (*)  - SAVEing programs to tape now really works (if you're a

27/7/92         Version 1.41 released. The 1.40 version of Z80.EXE was
                packed with COMPACK (sort of PKLITE), which was bugged:
                it didn't run on some '386s and '486s. This version isn't
                packed anymore.



16/7/92         Version 1.40 released, Shareware and for registered

                adapters.
         (*)  - A utility to read DISCiPLE floppies.
              - The analogue IBM joystick and a special interface for
                digital (Spectrum) joysticks are supported. In the
                documentation file is a diagram for the digital joystick
                interface.
              - A more extensive manual, and a summary for English-
                speaking users.
              - Speed measurement of the Z80 emulator is more accurate.
                (V1.20 overestimated the speed.)
              - Function keys F1-F7 and F10 are now used.
              - The Emulator can run in 'Real'-mode, for better sound
                and for tape (speed-)load and save.
              - R register emulation is now perfect, so that protected
                games (e.g. lenslock games) can be loaded.
              - Video routines are faster.
              - Several bugfixes concerning writes in ROM. (Strong Man)

                stored in .Z80 files.



6/11/91         Version 1.30, for registered users only:

              - It is now much easier to choose a file from the main
                menu: the cursor keys, PgUp and PgDn can be used to
                browse through the list of files, and letter-keys make
                the bar jump to the first file that starts with that
                letter. The files are now alphabetically ordered.
              - Sinclair joystick 1 added (keys 1-5)
              - If a path is entered at the command line, the Emulator
                automatically jumps to the main menu, option 'load
                program', and changes to the specified directory.
              - If a file is attached to the RS232 in- or output
                channel, the read- or write-position is shown (main
                menu, options I and O)
              - Switches -yl and -yh are added, for Low and High video
                synchronisation. With these switches, the flickering of
                sprites of some games can be reduced. (Ghost 'n Goblins,
                Uridium)
              - Bugfix: DOS-clock ran too fast in version 1.25
              - Bugfix: On AT's the Emulator crashed if Spectrum programs
                used interrupt mode 2 while the I register was 255.
                (Full Throttle)
              - Unofficial flags are now emulated better. (Ghost'n Goblins)
         (*)  - Extra utility CONVZ80, converts .Z80 files in .SP and
                .SNA files, the snapshot formats of the Spanish Spectrum
                emulator VGASPEC and the Norwegian Spectrum emulator JPP
                respectively, and vice versa.
         (*)  - Utility Z80DUMP; displays the header of .Z80 files.

              - Bugfix of instructions CB30 to CB37 (Bounder)
              - 50 Hz interrupt and video update run 180 degrees out of
                phase (BC Quest for Tires)
              - SLA, SRA, SRL sped up.
         (*)  - Switch -z added: the Emulator now can be slowed down to
                about a factor 4.
              - Bugfix sound: some computers only produced sound after a
                OUT 31,13.
              - Switch -2 added for Issue-2 emulation (Spinads)
              - Bugfix GETRS: now reading from COM2 works, and an
                on-screen counter shows the progress.
         (*)  - CONVERT extended: GIF-files can be made directly from
                .Z80 files
