Some remarks about the source files:
====================================

To make CONVZ80, assemble convz80.8 using A86
To make CONVERT, assemble convcode.8 to convcode.obj, compile convert.c and
   link it with convcode.obj. (With BCC 3.1 use a .PRJ project file; with
   Turbo C 2.0 link it by hand) To make Z802TAP, compile z802tap.c and link
   it with loader.obj
To make READSB, execute the following (for Borland C:)

bcc -mc -O2 -Id:\bc4\include -Ld:\bc4\lib -c  sounddev.cpp
bcc -mc -O2 -Id:\bc4\include -Ld:\bc4\lib -c  sbdevice.cpp
bcc -mc -O2 -Id:\bc4\include -Ld:\bc4\lib -c  readsb.cpp
tasm  dma_code.asm
tlink \bc4\lib\c0c sounddev sbdevice dma_code readsb,readsb,,\bc4\lib\cc \bc4\lib\emu \bc4\lib\fp87 \bc4\lib\mathc

(Compact model, Optimization level 2, Compile only)

The rest is easy.

The source files of the SamRam are in SAMSRC.TAP, in the format used by
   GENS3.  If you don't have GENS3 you can convert the source files to
   text files using SAMLIST.BAT.  Sorry about the lack of comments, but memory
   was scarce back then!
